In addition, all posters can email a single catchy graphic,
with a `poster_id` `Px.y` reference to `adass2018[at]astro.umd.edu`,
to be part of the conference slide show that we will showcase at the
registration desk as well as during breaks in Salon AB.
Please name your file `Px-y.png` or `Px-y.jpg`.

To remake the PNG, open up slide in OpenOffice and export as PNG.
